Easy Nodejs Setup
===============


This project is a simple setup I want to have for other projects. 

It contains the following: 

 - frontend with live-reload and access to backend
 - auto-reload for backend with nodemon
 - js-standard linter
 - a build that packs minimized version of the project to tar.gz. (TBD)
